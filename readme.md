# Instrument Template for Kontakt
## About
This is my microtonal instrument template for Kontakt. It allows precise polyrhythmic delays, spatial manipulations and Karplus-Strong synthesis. You can also latch the frequency of the Karplus-Strong algorithm, which is a feature I didn't see anywhere else.
You are allowed to use this template for your personal projects. Using this code in commercial instruments for sale is NOT allowed.

## Requirements:
Kontakt v. 6.8 (previous versions might also work but there has been some glitches observed in Kontakt 5).
